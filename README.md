That's all it is - a text editor for the web for those devices which don't have them.

### Why is it on vocabustudy.org?
Do you think I have enough money to buy another domain?

## Features
 - [x] Create, edit, and view multiple text files with names
 - [x] Syntax highlighting for various languages
 - [ ] Open files from the OS file manager and save files to it
 - [x] Line/column count
 - [ ] Sharing (maybe??)

## Isn't this one of many text editors?
### Google Docs
Google Docs has too many features and you can't write code in it. It's also all in the cloud

### Google Keep
Again, it's in the cloud. It's designed for smaller "notes"

### Every single other online text editor out there
This is way cooler
